Sui is different than other blockchains. The concepts explored in this section provide a background to the Sui blockchain and Web3 in general.

## App developers [​](https://docs.sui.io/concepts\#app-developers "Direct link to App developers")

## Move overview

Move is an open-source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects

## Package upgrades

Sui provides a method of upgrading your packages while still retaining their immutable properties.

## Gaming on Sui

Sui offers features like dynamic NFTs, kiosks, soulbound assets, and on-chain randomness, to provide builders with the tools to create immersive, transparent, and fair gaming experiences.

## The Move Book

A comprehensive guide to the Move programming language on the Sui blockchain.

## Objects [​](https://docs.sui.io/concepts\#objects "Direct link to Objects")

## Object Model

Everything on the Sui blockchain is an object, with metadata, type of ownership, and a referencing scheme.

## Transfer to Object

On Sui, you can transfer objects to objects in the same way you can transfer objects to addresses.

## Cryptography [​](https://docs.sui.io/concepts\#cryptography "Direct link to Cryptography")

## zkLogin

zkLogin is a Sui primitive that enables you to send transactions from a Sui address using an OAuth credential, without publicly linking the two.

## Transaction authentication

Transaction security is arguably the most important feature of a blockchain. Sui provides multiple features to secure your transactions, whether on chain or off.

## Tokenomics [​](https://docs.sui.io/concepts\#tokenomics "Direct link to Tokenomics")

## SUI tokenomics

The term "tokenomics" is a combination of two words, “token” and “economics”, that is generally used to describe the economic principles and behaviors of a blockchain.

## Gas in Sui

A Sui transaction must pay for both the computational cost of execution and the long-term cost of storing the objects a transaction creates or mutates.

## Vesting strategies

If you plan to launch a token on Sui, then you might consider implementing a vesting strategy to strengthen the long-term outlook of your token.
