Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform. That might read like marketing speak, but as you peruse the documentation to understand the technology, you will discover that Sui addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption.

Before you can get started developing on Sui, you need to understand the code repository and install its binaries.

## Install Sui [​](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started\#install-sui "Direct link to Install Sui")

Use one of the following commands for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (MacOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (Windows), or [suiup](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup) (a custom installer and version manager for Sui related tools) to install Sui.

- Homebrew
- Chocolatey
- suiup (experimental)

```codeBlockLines_p187
$ brew install sui

```

You can also install Sui from binaries or from source, as detailed in the Install Sui page.

Go to [Install Sui](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).

## After installing Sui [​](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started\#after-installing-sui "Direct link to After installing Sui")

After you have Sui installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts.
